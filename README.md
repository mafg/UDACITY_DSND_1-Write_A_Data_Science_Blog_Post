## Investigation

The aim of this notebook is to answer to 3 (and something more) business questions over the AirBnB datasets of Boston:

* How the price rates changes during the year? Local maximum/minimum or spike?
* Anythings about the properties that affects the base price rates?
* Is it possible to predict price rates by means of the available data? 

A blog post with a non-technical discussion can be found [here](https://medium.com/@marco_f/the-perfect-holiday-doesnt-exi-faa3b6bbe18a).
